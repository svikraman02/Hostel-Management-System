   cd Hostel-Management-System


## ```

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Install Java (version 8 or above)**.
- **Clone the Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/svikraman02/Hostel-Management-System.git


- Ensure CSV files are placed in the appropriate `DataBase` folder structure.

### 2. Compile and Run the Application
- **Using an IDE**: Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and run the `Main.java` file.
  - In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click the `Main.java` file and select `Run 'Main'`.
  - In Eclipse, right-click the `Main.java` file and choose `Run As -> Java Application`.

### 3. Database Configuration
- Ensure that the `DataBase` folder contains the correct CSV files before running the application. The system reads and writes to these files for various operations such as marking attendance and managing student data.
  - **Add or Modify CSV Files**: If needed, you can create your own CSV files following the structure of the existing ones.
  - **Check File Permissions**: Ensure that the application has the correct permissions to read and write files in the `DataBase` directory.
  - **Email Configuration**: To enable email functionality for notifications or feedback, please enter your **email ID** and **password generated by Google SMTP** in the `Mail.java` file located in the `Email` folder.
    - **Get Google SMTP Password**:
    - To use Google's SMTP server, you need to enable **Less Secure Apps** or generate an **App Password** if you have 2-Step Verification enabled.
    - **Steps for 2-Step Verification users**:
      1. Go to your Google Account settings: [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
      2. Under the **Security** tab, scroll to **App passwords**.
      3. Sign in with your Google credentials if prompted.
      4. Select **Mail** as the app and **Windows Computer** (or any device) as the device.
      5. Click **Generate** and copy the 16-character password that appears.
      6. Enter this generated password in the `Mail.java` file where the email password is needed.
    - **For users without 2-Step Verification**:
      1. Enable Less Secure Apps on your Google account by visiting this [link](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) and turning the setting ON.
      2. Use your regular Google account password in the `Mail.java` file.

  - **Add JAR Files to Dependencies**: Please add the following JAR files to your IDE dependencies for email functionality:
    - `activation-1.1.1.jar`
